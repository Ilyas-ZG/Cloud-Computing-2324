I chose node:18-alpine for several reasons, one of which is that my project is
 straightforward and doesn't require anything complex. Alpine images are very lightweight, 
significantly reducing the size of the Docker container, This means improved deployment efficiency and resource management.  
node:18-alpine is specifically optimized for running Node.js applications, prove a ready-to-use environment for their development 
and deployment. The simplicity and efficiency of this image align well with the uncomplicated nature of my project,
 making it an ideal choice for enhancing deployment effectiveness and optimizing resource utilization.
