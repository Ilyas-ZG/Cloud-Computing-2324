# RentMe :red_car:

Nowadays, many types of transport are available and accessible to almost everyone, by bus, train or car, you can go wherever you want, but you're always be afraid of missing the departure time or the place you're leaving from, especially if you don't know the place or the town.  
Car rental agencies often impose conditions for their customers to rent a car from them, and these conditions are sometimes difficult or not permitted for everyone.  
You may often find applications to rent rooms or houses but not for cars.   
**RentMe** is an app that lets you rent your car in the region or in specific areas, for as long as you like if the car of your choice is available
